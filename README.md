# Beat The Bookie

Beat the Bookie was a challenge over 4 weeks to produce a classifier for Win, Draw or Loss outcomes of football matches. This challenge is based on the Kaggle NCAA March Madness Analytics Prediction competition [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-madness-analytics-2020).

The notebook in this repository shows the process of data analysis, data transformation, methodology exploration (including logistic regression, linear SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes) and performance analytics, including the process of choosing a model validator.
